# Python 200 Assignments Hub
Welcome to the assignment hub for Python 200! Each week of the course has its own assignment file (for example, `01_analysis_assignment.md`). These assignments are designed to help you practice the material from that week, build confidence, and gradually develop real-world analysis, AI,  and cloud computing skills.

Each week the assignments will be broken up into two parts -- warmup exercises, and larger-scale projects: 

## Part I: Warmup Exercises
Part I is all about easy wins. These questions should feel approachable if you have worked through the main lesson material. They focus on basic syntax, concepts, and short coding tasks to help you build muscle memory.

We **strongly** encourage you to not use AI for these warmups: they are meant to help you practice the kinds of tasks you will be expected to do, and discuss, in live coding interviews. These are questions that AI can easily answer very quickly, but that would defeat the purpose. 

## Part II: Projects
Part II is where you put things together into larger-scale prooject-based tasks. We'll give you one to three each week. They will typically involve pulling ideas from multiple topics for the week. A mini-project might ask you to load a real dataset, clean it, visualize patterns, or build a small analysis or AI pipeline. These projects usually take a few hours and represent the kind of work that real data analysts, ML engineers, or AI developers do.

## How to Submit Your Work

Like with Python 100, each weekly assignment file will explain how you should submit your work: sometimes through your GitHub repo, sometimes through Kaggle notebooks. Follow the instructions in the assignment for that week.

If you're ever unsure, ask in Slack — we're here to help.
