# Lesson N: Lesson Title
Template for weekly assignment for Python 200 lessons. Replace the placeholders with the correct lesson number, title, and tasks.

Here we would include a short paragraph reminding students how to complete and turn in their work (for example: submit via GitHub, Kaggle, or as instructed in the specific lesson).


## Part 1: Warmup Exercises

These should be short, approachable tasks that reinforce the basic concepts from the lesson. Encourage students to turn off Copilot/AI assistance and solve these on their own.

### Task 1
Describe the first warmup exercise here.

### Task 2
Describe the second warmup exercise here.

### Task N
Add as many warmup tasks as needed.


## Part 2: Projects

Mini-projects should combine multiple concepts from the week. They are meant to be more open-ended and take more time (2-10 hours). 

### Project 1

Describe the mini-project here. Add instructions, dataset links, expected outputs, or any helpful notes.
