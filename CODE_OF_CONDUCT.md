# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to strive to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers and contributors are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

They also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project publicly. 


## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at [thomson.eric@gmail.com](mailto:thomson.eric@gmail.com), or to any member of Code the Dream staff on Slack or via email. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Also, the privacy of the reporter of any incident will be respected.
