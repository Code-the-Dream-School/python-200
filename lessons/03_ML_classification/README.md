# Week 3: Machine Learning: Classification
Welcome to Week 3 of Python 200! Last week we built intuition for machine learning using regression -- predicting a continuous value from data. This week we turn to *classification*: predicting which category something belongs to. Is this email spam? Is this tumor malignant? Will this customer churn? Classification is one of the most common tasks in applied ML, and this week you will build real classifiers and learn how to evaluate whether they are actually working.

Along the way, we will also dig into two topics that matter for nearly every ML project: data preprocessing and feature engineering (transforming raw data into something a model can actually learn from), and classifier evaluation (moving beyond simple accuracy to metrics that give you a clearer picture of model performance).

> For an introduction to the course, and a discussion of how to set up your environment, please see the [Welcome](../README.md) page.

## Topics
1. [Data preprocessing and feature engineering](01_preprocessing.md)  
A brief overview of data preprocessing and feature engineering for machine learning, including principal component analysis (PCA). A lot of this will be review from Python 100, and we will be giving a hands-on demo of PCA. 

2. [Evaluating classifier performance](02_classifier_evaluation.md)
How do we evaluate classifier performance? How do you tell if a pipeline is performing well, or if one is better than another? There are multiple metrics. We introduce this using a practical example.

3. [k-Nearest Neighbor Classifiers](03_knn.md)  
Hands on work with k-nearest neighbor classifiers, the hello world of classification.  

4. [Logistic Regression](04_logistic_regression.md)
For our final practical classification example, we will use logistic regression, which creates highly interpretable classifiers that are roughly equivalent to neurons (this is low-key good preparation for deep learning next week).

## Week 3 Assignments
Once you finish the lessons, head on over to the [assignments](../../assignments/README.md) to get more hands-on practice with the material. Good luck!
