# Week 3: Machine Learning: Classification
> Draft readme to be completed once material is finished.
> 
Welcome to Week 3 of Python 200! This week we will do a deeper dive into the world of classification using scikit-learn. 

> To fill in later: brief motivational preview here. Briefly explain why this lesson matters, what students will be able to do by the end, and what topics will be covered. Keep it tight and motivating.

> For an introduction to the course, and a discussion of how to set up your environment, please see the [Welcome](../README.md) page.  

## Topics
1. [Data preprocessing and feature engineering](01_preprocessing.md)  
Overview of data preprocessing and feature enginnering, including principal component analysis.

2. [k-Nearest Neighbor Classifiers](02_knn.md)  
Overview of k-nearest neighbor classifiers, including review of how to evaluate classifiers using measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and other measures.

3. [Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning](03_decision_trees.md)  
We will learn decision tree classifiers, but also random forests, so we can learn about ensesmble learning. 

4. [Logistic Regression](03_logistic_regression.md)  
For our final practical classification example, we will use logistic regression, which creates highly interpretable classifiers that are roughly equivalent to single neurons.
