# Week 2: Introduction to Machine Learning
Welcome to Week 2 of Python 200! This week we start our journey into machine learning -- what it is, how it works, and how to put it into practice using one of Python's most important libraries, scikit-learn. By the end of the week you will have built and evaluated a linear regression model.

Machine learning (ML) models are embedded in many pipelines that you will help build and maintain.For instance, nonprofits predicting food insecurity in a community, public health teams modeling disease spread, environmental organizations tracking deforestation from satellite imagery, city governments routing emergency resources after a disaster. In all of these cases, someone needs to build and maintain the pipelines that feed data into those models, monitor their outputs, and keep everything running reliably. That someone is often a data engineer. Understanding ML -- what models need, what their outputs mean, and how to evaluate whether they are working -- makes you a far more effective collaborator and a more versatile engineer.

The first couple of weeks we will cover *classical* ML. This is still the workhorse of most production systems, and it is the right place to build intuition before we move on to deep learning and large language models in later weeks.

## Topics

1. [Introduction to machine learning](01_machine_learning.md)
A big-picture overview of the ML landscape: what machine learning is, how it relates to AI and deep learning, and the main types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement). 

2. [Introduction to scikit-learn](02_scikit_learn.md)
An introduction to scikit-learn, the go-to library for classical ML in Python. We will look at its API and see it in action with a couple of quick examples.

3. [Intro to Linear Regression](03_linear_regression.md)
Our first real ML model. We will train a linear regression model on housing data, evaluate it with standard metrics, and develop intuition for what those metrics mean.
