# Week 4: Machine Learning: Deep Learning
Welcome to Week 4 of Python 200! This week we will explore the world of deep learning, a powerful subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data. This is probably the most ambitious week of the course, but also one of the most exciting.

Deep learning is the foundation of all modern AI systems like ChatGPT (text-based LLMs), DALL-E (image-generating AI), and many others. By understanding deep learning, you will gain insights into how these systems work and how to help build pipelines and applications that leverage them. The focus is on building intuition and understanding -- not deep mathematical theory.

Things will be a bit different this week: we will be using PyTorch on Kaggle for our lessons and assignments, so we don't have to worry about installation issues. On Kaggle, there is 30 hours of free GPU usage, which is essential for hands-on deep learning.

However, if you want to install PyTorch on your own machine for practice, you can find out how at their [official installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Just bear in mind that your mentors probably won't be able to provide debugging and support for PyTorch issues.

> For an introduction to the course, and a discussion of how to set up your environment, please see the [Welcome](../README.md) page.  

## Topics
1. [Introduction to neural networks and deep learning](01_deep_intro.md)  
A brief introduction to neural networks and deep learning. What are they, how do they work, how do they learn?

2. [Introduction to pytorch](02_pytorch_intro.md)  
An overview of the PyTorch library, mainly focusing on tensor operations. Note this week you will see "Open in Kaggle" buttons for the material, where you will be running the code. 

3. [Training your first neural network](03_first_neural_network.md)  
Before diving into more complex models, we will start by training a simple neural network in PyTorch to gain an understanding of the basic workflow for training and evaluating a model -- a workflow that carries over to much more complex architectures as well.

4. [Machine vision intro](04_cnn_inference.md)  
For this section, we will use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images, to show how deep neural networks can be used for computer vision tasks.

5. [Transfer learning: learning new tasks](05_transfer_learning.md)
Here, we will explore transfer learning, which is a technique that allows us to use a pre-trained models for new tasks with limited data. We will fine-tune a pre-trained CNN to learn to classify clothing types.

## Week 4 Assignments
Once you finish the lessons, head on over to the [assignments](../../assignments/README.md) to get more hands-on practice with the material.
