## Topic 3: Training your first neural network

In this topic, we train a simple neural network using the classic concentric circles classification problem. This dataset contains two classes arranged in nested circular patterns, making it an intuitive example of a nonlinear classification task. The goal is to learn the core workflow for training a model in PyTorch, including preparing data, defining a model, computing loss, optimizing parameters, and evaluating performance.
