# Week 8: Introduction to Cloud Computing

Welcome to Week 8 of Python 200 -- and welcome to the cloud. 🌩️

Over the past seven weeks you have built a serious foundation: statistical thinking, classical machine learning, deep learning, large language models, RAG, and AI agents. That is a genuine achievement, and you should feel good about it. But there is a gap between building something on your laptop and deploying it somewhere it can actually be used. The cloud is where that gap gets closed.

Cloud platforms are the infrastructure that makes modern data engineering possible -- scalable storage, managed databases, on-demand compute, ML services, and the pipelines that tie it all together. In the final stretch of this course, you will learn to work in that environment. We are using Microsoft Azure, which is one of the three main cloud platforms in enterprise and nonprofit settings.

This week is about getting oriented. By the end of it, you will understand the core concepts of cloud computing, have your own workspace set up in Azure, and be ready for the hands-on work ahead.

> For an introduction to the course, and a discussion of how to set up your environment, please see the [Welcome](../README.md) page.


## Topics
1. [Cloud overview](01_cloud_overview.md)
A platform-agnostic introduction to cloud computing: what it is, why it matters, and what changes when you move from running code on your laptop to running it in the cloud. We cover the core concepts you will encounter regardless of which cloud provider you use.

2. [A Practical Introduction to Azure](02_azure_intro.md)
Your first hands-on introduction to Azure. We will make sure you can log in, navigate the portal, and get set up with your own resource group -- the sandbox you will use for the rest of the course.

## Week 8 Assignments
Once you finish the lessons, head on over to the [assignments](../../assignments/README.md) to get more hands-on practice with the material.
