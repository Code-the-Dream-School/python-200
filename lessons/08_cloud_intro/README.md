# Week 1: Introduction to AI

Welcome to the Week 8 in Python 200, Introduction to Cloud Computing!

> To fill in later: brief motivational preview here. Briefly explain why this lesson matters, what students will be able to do by the end, and what topics will be covered. Keep it tight and motivating.

> For an introduction to the course, and a discussion of how to set up your environment, please see the [Welcome](../README.md) page.  


## Topics
1. [Cloud overview](01_cloud_overview.md)  
Platform-agnostic oveview of the what-and-why of cloud computing. This is a big shift for the students, so we want to motivate why they should care about the cloud when they can just run code on their laptop. :smile: For the assignment, we'll have lots of questions about cloud concepts that are less hands-on than the other weeks of Python 100/200.

1. [A Practical Introduction to Azure](02_azure_intro.md)  
This will be their first hands-on introduction to Azure. The main focus is on making sure students can log in and access the portal, and familiarizing them with the basic layout and organization of the portal. I'm assuming this will be a heavy week of troubleshooting, so nothing too heavy. The assignments should be mostly about logging in and making sure things are working for the students, getting acquainted with the portal. 

- Logging in and getting to the portal (log in etc)
-  Overview of portal it's their first time in the cloud! ðŸŽ‰
- Run and use Azure CLI (something simple exploring the file system): it's just bash but in the cloud. 
- Write/run a simple python script from IDE (they can `runcode .` from CLI and start VS Code in cloud): again, it's effectively VS Code but in the cloud. 
- Show how to set cost alerts
- Explore cost estimator for significant job that they won't actually do but is costly (using some of the resources/services discussed in 1)
