### What is AI Ethics?

Ethics are moral principles which help us differentiatie between what is right or wrong. We follow those principles to be on right track. AI Ethics field studies on optimizing impact of AI which helps reduce risks and adverse outcomes. 

### AI Ethics Includes:
AI is huge umbrella including machine lachining and more firleds which exposes to a wide space outside where these algorithms can make decisions and also can guide humans. For further issues of concerns whcih can withhold legal exposure resuslting in costly penalties due to lack of diligence. 

### Ethical issues aroused due to Genrative AI:

1. Bias, Misrepresenatation

When collected datasets is used for training the AI Models. AImodels sometimes misrepsent, underrepsrent certain socail identites and practices, which leads for the models reflecting biases. For eg: AI was used in bank to give loan on studying the data. It interpresnted only males should be apporved for loan. This led to male dominated situation leading to bias. 
the decisona choices gets baised by the AI models.

2. Misinformation and Disinformation
Mnay of the times AI is getting used to populate false information, video, images. These tools are sued to customize information at scale which leads to harasment campaigns. In real time, it is sometimes diffciult to detect the real difference between real content and false information which is AI generated. 
Hallunications are rapidly in a rise and it's still challenging to overcome in all.

3. Privacy and Data Extraction
When large datasets containing personal information from the web are given to large langauge models, they can infer user details like age, gender, location and more. This makes data leak takes places. Researchers are able to identify certain ways where the prompt systems will be able to reveal all training data directly.

### How we can be careful while using Generative AI ?
1. Appropriate use
We can always discuss with our proeffors, seniors, mentors about the tools and policies before even starting to use AI for any development/ research. We should be intentional while suing the tools - understanding the puporse of the feature and verifying if the information is legitimate. 

2. Privacy, security
Be careful what data are you sharing with the tool. Many times the tools save the data in their memory after chats/prompts. Keeping that data and may later be used else where it shouldnt be discloing the personal data. For eg. we should not be sharing our soical security number.

### Generative AI Tools Limitations
While AI has numerous benefits, it's essential to consider the potential fallbacks. Some pressing concerns when building AI applications include:
    1. AI tools may genreate wrong information or hallucinate(inaccurate information). THere might be an instant that AI refered to a link cited or directed to that source but when verified it may not be having those details. 
    2. AI tools may overgeneralize or provide information which is inapprociate. 

### Understanding Generative AI Outputs:
We should understand its a tool and not real source for considerting it true what information it shares. As, the tool is built from predictions. We should verify the information given by the AI tool. 
We should consider few aspects before considering the output of generative AI tool. 
- Bias: When datasets exclude some community information or practices then the model may may misrepresent and we should consider models output in context to what perspectice is it and if its not reproducing harmful social association in outputs. 

- Accuracy: Tools may hallucinate meaning producing inaccurate information. This is impossible to eliminate totally and it also diffcult to identify this wrong information. Also, when we havent provided any background details or information for a topic then it lacks in real context creating generalized summary with lack of depth.

- Transparency: AI tools are like balck box problem, even developers have no idea how the data is processed or retrived to generate response. Tools have system prompts embedded in each inout which end users do not see.
