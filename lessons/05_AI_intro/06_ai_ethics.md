### What is AI Ethics?

Ethics are moral principles which help us differentiatie ebtween what is right or wrong. We follow those principles to be right track. AI Ethics field studies on optimizing impact of AI which helps reduce risks and adverse outcomes.

### AI Ethics Includes:
AI is huge umbrella including machine lachining and more firleds which exposes to a wide space outside where these algorithms can make decisions and also can guide humans. For further issues of concerns whcih can withhold legal exposure resuslting in costly penalties due to lack of diligence. 

What does really AI Ethics include?
AI should respect human ethics, including respect, no harm, transparency, and accountability.
Few examples below should be consiered while working with AI. 

Transparency & Explainability → AI systems should be understandable, and their decisions explainable to users.

Fairness & Non-Discrimination → AI must avoid bias and treat all individuals fairly.

Accountability → Clear responsibility must be assigned for AI outcomes.

Privacy & Data Protection → Safeguard user data with strong security and privacy measures.

Human-Centered Design → AI should augment human decision-making, not replace or harm it.

Safety & Reliability → AI must be tested thoroughly to work reliably in different conditions.

Sustainability → AI development should consider environmental and social impact.

Continuous Monitoring & Improvement → Regularly evaluate AI systems for risks and unintended consequences.

### How we can be careful while using Generative AI ?
1. Appropriate use
We can always discuss with our proeffors, seniors, mentors about the tools and policies before even starting to use AI for any development/ research. We should be intentional while suing the tools - understanding the puporse of the feature and verifying if the information is legitimate. 

2. Privacy, security
Be careful what data are you sharing with the tool. Many times the tools save the data in their memory after chats/prompts. Keeping that data and may later be used else where it shouldnt be discloing the personal data. For eg. we should not be sharing our soical security number.

3. Generative AI Tools
While AI has numerous benefits, it's essential to consider the potential fallbacks. Some pressing concerns when building AI applications include:
    Prompt Injection: Attempts to cause harm or behave contrary to deployment experts.
    Memorization Leaked Prompt: Not disclosing private data.

Some tools may hallucinate(generate false information). So, we should not be considering AI as source authority.
