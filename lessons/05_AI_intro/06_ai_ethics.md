### What is AI Ethics?

Ethics are moral principles which help us differentiatie between what is right or wrong. We follow those principles to be on the right track. The AI Ethics field studies on optimizing the impact of AI, which helps reduce risks and adverse outcomes. 

### AI Ethics Includes:

AI is a huge umbrella including machine learning and more fields which exposes to a wide space outside where these algorithms can make decisions and also can guide humans. For further issues of concern whcih can withhold legal exposure resulting in costly penalties due to lack of diligence. 

### Ethical issues arose due to Generative AI:

1. Bias, Misrepresentation

When collected datasets are used for training the AI Models. AImodels sometimes misrepresent, underrepresent certain socail identites and practices, which leads for the models reflecting biases. For eg: AI was used in bank to give loan on studying the data. It interpreted that only males should be approved for loan. This led to male-dominated situation, leading to bias. 
The decision-making choices get biased by the AI models.

2. Misinformation and Disinformation

Many of the times AI is getting used to populate false information, video, images. These tools are used to customize information at scale, which leads to harassment campaigns. In real time, it is sometimes difficult to detect the real difference between real content and false information that is AI-generated. 
Hallucinations are rapidly in a rise, and it's still challenging to overcome in all.

Here's to understand more why Hallucinations take place: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664

3. Privacy and Data Extraction

When large datasets containing personal information from the web are given to large langauge models, they can infer user details like age, gender, location, and more. This makes a data leak take place. Researchers have found specific methods that allow prompt systems to directly reveal all their training data.

### How can we be careful while using Generative AI?

1. Appropriate use

We can always discuss with our professors, seniors, and mentors about the tools and policies before even starting to use AI for any development/ research. We should be intentional while using the tools - understanding the purpose of the feature and verifying if the information is legitimate. 

2. Privacy, security

Be careful what data you are sharing with the tool. Many times, the tools save the data in their memory after chats/prompts. Keeping that data and may later be used elsewhere, where it shouldnt be disclosing the personal data. For eg. we should not be sharing our social security number.

### Generative AI Tools Limitations

While AI has numerous benefits, it's essential to consider the potential drawbacks. Some pressing concerns when building AI applications include:

    1. AI tools may generate wrong information or hallucinate(inaccurate information). There might be an instance that AI referred to a link cited or directed to that source, but when verified, it may not be having those details. 

    2. AI tools may overgeneralize or provide information that is inappropriate. 

### Understanding Generative AI Outputs:

We should understand it's a tool and not a real source for considering it true what information it shares. As the tool is built from predictions. We should verify the information given by the AI tool. 

We should consider a few aspects before considering the output of a generative AI tool. 

- Bias: When datasets exclude some community information or practices, then the model may misrepresent, and we should consider the model's output in context to what perspective it is, and if it's not reproducing harmful social associations in outputs. 

- Accuracy: Tools may hallucinate meaning, producing inaccurate information. This is impossible to eliminate totally, and it is also difficult to identify this wrong information. Also, when we havent provided any background details or information for a topic, then it lacks in real context, creating a generalized summary with a lack of depth.

- Transparency: AI tools are like black box problem, even developers have no idea how the data is processed or retrieved to generate a response. Tools have system prompts embedded in each input which end users do not see.
