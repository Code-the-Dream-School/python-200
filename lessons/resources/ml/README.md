# Resources for Machine Learning Module

Resources such as essential images, data (CSV/JSON files), etc., for the machine learning module in Python 200.

## Guidelines for Contributors
- Put only machine-learning lesson related resources here.
- Keep file sizes small (under 1MB); large datasets should live outside the repo to be downloaded in individual lessons.
- Use jpg for images to keep files small.
- Use descriptive filenames, e.g. `gradient_descent_example.jpg` or `mnist_sample.csv`.
- Reference resources in lessons with relative paths, e.g.:

  ```markdown
