# Resources for Analysis Module

Resources such as essential images, data (CSV/JSON files), etc., for the analysis module in Python 200.

## Guidelines for Contributors
- Put only analysis-related resources here.
- Keep file sizes small (under 1MB); large datasets should live outside the repo to be downloaded in individual lessons.
- Use jpg for images to keep files small.
- Use descriptive filenames, e.g. `histogram_example.jpg` or `sales_data_sample.csv`.
- Reference resources in lessons with relative paths, e.g.:

  ```markdown
  ![Histogram Example](resources/analysis/histogram_example.jpg)
