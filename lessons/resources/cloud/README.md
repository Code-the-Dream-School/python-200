# Resources for Cloud Computing Module

Resources such as essential images, data (CSV/JSON files), etc., for the cloud computing module in Python 200.

## Guidelines for Contributors
- Put only cloud computing lesson related resources here.
- Keep file sizes small (under 1MB); large datasets should live outside the repo to be accessed in individual lessons.
- Use jpg for images to keep files small.
- Use descriptive filenames, e.g. `azureML_sdk_flowchart.jpg` or `sales_roi.csv`.
- Reference resources in lessons with relative paths, e.g.:

  ```markdown
  ![Azure ML SDK Flowchart](resources/ml/azureML_sdk_flowchart.jpg)
